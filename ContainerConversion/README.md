Queries to find potential conversion problems before moving to top containers
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 * [CreateCandidates.sql](https://github.com/YaleArchivesSpace/ArchivesSpaceQueries/blob/master/ContainerConversion/CreateCandidates.sql) -- The first step for checking problems with barcodes and locations before converting to top container model
 * [ProblemBarcodes.sql](https://github.com/YaleArchivesSpace/ArchivesSpaceQueries/blob/master/ContainerConversion/ProblemBarcodes.sql) -- This report will reveal which barcodes have been assigned to more than one container. These must be fixed before conversion. CreateCandidates.sql needs to be run first to create temporary tables before this report will work.
 * [QuantumContainers.sql](https://github.com/YaleArchivesSpace/ArchivesSpaceQueries/blob/master/ContainerConversion/QuantumContainers.sql) -- This report will reveal cases where the same container has been assigned to more than one location. This isn't physically possible! These need to be fixed before conversion. CreateCandidates.sql needs to be run first to create temporary tables before this report will work.
 * [FindRangesBeforeContainerMigration.sql](https://github.com/YaleArchivesSpace/ArchivesSpaceQueries/blob/master/1.4.2/FindRangesBeforeContainerMigration.sql) -- See which containers have a dash (should indicate container range)
